# FlowComb

FlowComb was developed by [Orian Bricard](https://github.com/obricard/FlowComb).

FlowComb is an easy-to-use Rshiny app that will systematically identify all the combinations of differentially expressed markers. 
This is a very sensitive way of finding all the statistically different subpopulations between two groups.

To use it, you load in your data as correctly scaled exported csv files (e.g., CSV - Channel values with biexponential set).

You can pre-gate on specific cell populations or use the entire live cell population.
You then set thresholds on each marker in the app.

From there, the app generates a volcano plot of the fold change and p-value for each combination of markers between your control and experimental samples.
